This is a demo project designed to showcase an issue with the gatsby image plugin, and vercel.

The issue:

Site builds on vercel that run using the vercel cache cause an error with gatsby image. It seems like the high res versions of some images don't load.

Notes:

Images sourced from aitable - here is the view: https://airtable.com/shrURGIJv6a2AV189

The API key is included in the repository as this is an isolated, free airtable account created for the sake of this demo.
